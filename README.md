    </a>Country Information,Locator and Weather app</h1>

<p>This website is used to present information to a user,it has a simple to use layout which is easy to navigate.
<br>It shows current time and weather for Ireland, Upon selection of a country from a dropdown list it shows some<br> 
 information for that country,the location of that country and the current available weather for that country</p>

</a>UX</h2>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>The strategy for the site was to make a simple user friendly site that anyone of any age could use to find out<br>
 information about any country they would be interested in</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>I made the layout simple to use as i would hope that primary school children could use it to find out a bit more about the world around them.<br>
The interface is easy to use, just pick the country you are interested in and the site does the rest <br>
I wanted to make this site easy to use and as user friendly as possible, i believe that anyone can use this site without instruction</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The site has four main information panels, the first shows the current time,date and weather with the controls for accessing the rest of the site<br>
the second panel shows information regarding the selected country, the third panel shows the countries location<br>
 and the fourth shows current weather for that country.Each panel has a link to the next snippet of information until the end which has a link to bring <br>
 you back to the top of the site again</p>

<h3>Skeleton</h3>
<p>There is an attached file showing the original rough drawing for the site</p>

<h3>Surface</h3>
<p>I picked slategrey and black colours for the main part of the site with three global pictures and footer with an orange colour<br>
all the movement buttons are green and fade to red and the external links are red fading to green just to add a bit of colour</p>

</a>Features</h2>
<p>The site is simple in design, there are a few smooth scrolling jquery functions that bring you from panel to panel.<br>
The four main panels of information are simplistic in design and are all linked with the jquery scrolling function </p>

</a>Features Left to Implement</h2>
<p>I would like to add an error message that appears when there is no available weather information available for a country.<br>
I might add a drop down feature with more country info in the future although it would depend on how it looks on the site.<br>
I believe a dropdown would takeaway from the overall design of the site.<br>
I would have the weather at the top of the site linked to a geolocator as it is linked to current Irish weather at the moment. </p>

</a>Testing</h2>
<p>The site was tested on mobile devices manufactured by huawei,apple and samsung.it was tested on laptop devices and desktops <br>
of varying sizes and operating systems such as chrome,firefox, and edge, only slight styling changes were observed<br>
 all the scrolling functions work correctly on the differant devices and sites apart from edge: in edge the top image does not<br>
 render when you scroll up from the bottom using the scroll to top button, if you use the scroll bar on the side it is ok<br>
 alternating between using the scroll bar and button produces the same failure in sofar as the image is there using the bar<br>
 and not there when using the button. I had a look online to see if anyone else had the same issues but there was no fix relating<br>
 to the failure that i am experiencing, this is something which will have to be addressed with more experience<br>
  currently i would say that the site is not compatible with edge. On one occasion the flag img failed to update<br>
 This only happened the one time out of hundreds of tests so i did not investigate any further</p>

<p>During testing the new map failed to load maybe two-three times out of hundreds of querys,I moved the script for the map below the rest of the javascript<br>
and that seems to have resolved the issue, more tests may be needed here I also noticed on smaller devices there<br>
  is a white margin on the right side of the screen which was being caused by a row expanding beyond its parent container,<br>
  that seems to be fixed now also the weather for some of the countries that are a bit off the beaten track<br>
  do not seem to have any accessible weather data, I tried to implement an information message regarding the missing<br>
  weather data but all my attempts seemed to compromise the working of the site as it currently stands so I will have to fix<br>
  that in the future,currently if you request one of these countries first the 'no weather data' message remains(e.g:christmas island)<br>
  However if you request a country with weather data first and then the country without the weather data the data from the first request remains<br></p>

  <p>all coding was passed through validators, three red errors showed in the html validator but they are related to the unpopulated<br>
  image tag which is only populated after the search is initiated, it also showed an error for not having an alt image tag but if i put<br>
  that into the site it appears before any information is called and it does not look nice so i intentionally left it out<br>
  css has no errors, javascript validator showed up spacing issues,i fixed some of these and left others where i thought it made it easier to read the code.

<p>I found it difficult to implement the country drop down list correctly so i took code from a youtube tutorial<br>
The title of the tutorial is rest countries api by coding journey, the code can be seen at the 53min of the tutorial<br>
The code is stored in the countries.js file and is highlighted</p>
